You can download a sass template from my github 
stage->commit

git status
git commit -m <---- commit all staged files (or use vs codes gui)
git push
git add .

--------------------NEW BRANCH----------------
1.
git branch 'name' <--- create a new branch

2.
git checkout -b 'name'<----- switches to specified branch

3.
git branch <---- tells you what brach your on

---------------------UPDATE BRANCHES-----------------

1.
make sure you modify existing files instead of flatout replacing !

1.a
once you've updated a branch: 
git add . <----staged

2.
commit all changes
git commit -m 'message'


------------------Merging Branches-------------------------

Basic merging here, can be more complicated.
usually want to merge into main branch

1.
make sure both branches are clean

2.
git checkout to branch you want the changes on (usually main)

3. 
git merge 'name' <---- name of branch with changes (not main)

4.


----------Merging branches with different content (just updating main with new brach content, no overwrite)--------
not fast forward merge

merges two together and then makes a commit with both inside
1.
commit all changes

git commit -a -m "message"

2. go to main
merge the branch with main

git merge 'name' 

3. review any conflicts and then clean branch


--------Managing branches---------

1. findout which branches have been merged before
git branch --merged
git branch --no--merge

2. delete a branch
git branch -d 'name'

3. branches not merged, git will tell you cant do it
to do it:
git branch -D bugfix

----------Pushing to remote depots (online)----------
refer to pdfs for setting up a complete repo


1. push the main branch 
'git push'

2. push a brach thats not main
git push -u origin 'name'


-------- using the desktop app ------

---creating branches----
 you can keep branches private on machines by not publishing them, or alternatively you can upload them to the repo online by publishing them !

 Double check what your current branch is !

gh-pages
- create a repo called this and push to github.
- this will create a live link to the site, you can see
this on github under the environments 

---Merge branches in github desktop--

----Rolling back commits-----

1. Revert Commit:

- this merges the two commits.
- you will have to choose the changes
manually and manually commit the changes !
- you can still grab the pre revert files from history !


----Collaborating with github-----

1. copying a public github is called a fork
2. they must ask you for permission to submit a commit

1. Adding collaborators, read and write access:
2. settings > manage access > add collaborators

got to commits, look at history of files

LINE COMMENTS good for commit review
 
--- Issues ----

good way to communicate with others

MILESTONE
- set project milestones are hit, tracked with issues
- once issues are solved then the milestone is hit

LABELS
- default
- you can make own with color !


MAKING ISSUES 
- you cant delete issues... you can |CLOSE it....

---BEING A COLLABORATOR----

FORKING
copy's to your repo and you work on it separately and then make a pull request when you want to do changes

Alternative 

Collaborator clones main to own local repo and makes a branch and creates a pull request to update the main

Collaborator does not work on master branch

Owner makes a branch that collaborator can work on...

--PULL REQUEST----

A request to MERGE the collaborators branch with the main

Have one person manage pull requests and merges, they can approve or deny pull requests

creating pull request add comments 

---Manage pull requests---
